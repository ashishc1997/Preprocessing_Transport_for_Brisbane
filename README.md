# Preprocessing_Transport_for_Brisbane
The following repository is created to record the pre-processing steps needed to apply my performance evaluation methods  of transit routes.
For my MTech thesis, I have formulated a methodology to evaluate the performance of transit routes. Case study on Transport for Brisbane Public Transit (PT) network has been done.
The pre-processing of the data is done using the python script ''Final_sj"".
The input to this scrip are the Translink Origin-Destination trips (https://www.data.qld.gov.au/dataset/go-card-transaction-data) and the static data (GTFS) for Brisbane City of Australia (https://transitfeeds.com/p/translink/21?p=2).
The sample input files are in ""Static_Nov_2019"" and ""Demand Data"".
The files named ""Static_fil"" and ""Demand_fil"" contain the output from the code.
